## Removal notice

This repository has been integrated into [elastic/elasticsearch-php](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php) client and is no longer being maintained.

elasticsearch-x-pack-php
=================

** 
This repository contains the official X-Pack namespace module for Elasticsearch-PHP.  It is an optional module which
adds new APIs to the client if you are using X-Pack (Watcher, Monitoring, Graph, License, Security).

Version Matrix
--------------

| Elasticsearch-php Version | Elasticsearch-X-Pack-PHP Branch |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 5.0    | 5.0                   |



Installation
------------
This module is a set of additional API endpoints that can be accessed by the Elasticsearch-PHP client.  It is not a
standalone client, so make sure you have the `elasticsearch/elasticsearch` client in your `composer.json`.  Then simply
add the xpack module:


```json
{
    "require": {
        "elasticsearch/elasticsearch": "~5.0",
        "elasticsearch/xpack" : "~5.0"
    }
}
```

Then update your installation:


```bash
php composer.phar update
```


Using XPack
-----

Now that the XPack namspace is installed, we can inject individual XPack plugins that you are interested in using.
For example, we can inject just the Watcher namespace:



```php
use Elasticsearch\ClientBuilder;
use XPack\XPack;

$client = ClientBuilder::create()
            ->registerNamespace(XPack::Watcher()) // Inject the Watcher namespace
            ->build();
```

If you want to use multiple XPack plugins, chain together more `registerNamespace()` calls:

```php
use Elasticsearch\ClientBuilder;
use XPack\XPack;

$client = ClientBuilder::create()
            ->registerNamespace(XPack::Watcher())    // Inject the Watcher namespace
            ->registerNamespace(XPack::Security())   // Inject the Security namespace
            ->registerNamespace(XPack::Monitoring()) // Inject the Monitoring namespace
            ->build();
```

After the client has been initialized, you can invoke the registered namespaces via their name.  For example,
here we use the `watcher()` namespace (just like any other namespace that ships with the ES-PHP client):

```php
// Get watcher information
$watcherInfo = $client->watcher()->info();

// Get watcher stats
$watcherStats = $client->watcher()->stats();

// Add a new watch
$body = '{
 "trigger": {
   "schedule": {
     "hourly": {
       "minute": [ 0, 5 ]
       }
     }
 },
 "input": {
   "simple": {
     "payload": {
       "send": "yes"
     }
   }
 },
 "condition": {
   "always": {}
 },
 "actions": {
   "test_index": {
     "index": {
       "index": "test",
       "doc_type": "test2"
     }
   }
 }
}'
$params = [
    'id' => 'my_watch_id',
    'body' => $body
];
$response = $client->watcher()->putWatch($params);
```

Available Licenses
-------

Elasticsearch-X-Pack-PHP is available under two licenses: Apache v2.0 and LGPL v2.1.

The user may choose which license they wish to use.  Since there is no discriminating executable or distribution bundle
to differentiate licensing, the user should document their license choice externally, in case the library is re-distributed.
If no explicit choice is made, assumption is that redistribution obeys rules of both licenses.

### Contributions
All contributions to the library are to be so that they can be licensed under both licenses.
